## How its made
Technology used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Github pages

HTML: I used HTML to add the basic content such as headers, links, images, and paragraphs.

CSS: I used CSS and flexbox to style my content such as the title, score board, buttons to make moves, and replay button.

JavaScript: I used JavaScript to add the game logic to get random computer moves. With these computer moves it goes through a simple if statement to determine the winner of that round and updates the DOM to display the current scores. Once a player reaches 5 points the winner is displayed to the screen.

Github pages: Used to host the landing page.
