# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A fully working rock paper scissors game played right in the website. The goal is to beat a computer in a first to 5 game. The computer's moves are randomized for each round. A score board displays the scores of both the player and the computer after each round.

## How its made
Technology used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Github pages

HTML: I used HTML to add the basic content such as headers, links, images, and paragraphs.

CSS: I used CSS and flexbox to style my content such as the title, score board, images, and buttons.

JavaScript: I used JavaScript to add the game logic to get random computer moves. With these computer moves it goes through a simple if statement to determine the winner of that round. It also updates the DOM to display the current scores on the score board in real time.

Github pages: Used to host the landing page.

## What I learned
In this project I learned how to use JavaScript to edit the DOM in real time using query selecting and how to create elements custom elements when needed. I also learned how to appended these elements to the DOM and how to style them using JavaScript as opposed to using CSS. Finally, I learned about using event listeners to response to user input.

## Credits
Libresprite: I used this program to create the custom pixel art for this project.
